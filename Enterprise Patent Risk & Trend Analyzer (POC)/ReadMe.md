# Enterprise Patent Risk & Trend Analyzer (POC)

Welcome! 👋  
This project is a **Proof of Concept** for a modern enterprise platform that helps companies monitor, analyze, and predict patent risks and trends using AI, LLMs, and multi-agent protocols.

## 🚩 What’s the Big Idea?

- **Automatically aggregate global patent data and related news/articles using Bright Data and other APIs.**
- **Use LangChain and LLMs to extract, summarize, and highlight risks, infringements, and emerging trends.**
- **Employ MCP/A2A protocols to compose, orchestrate, and potentially collaborate across agent services.**
- **Expose REST API endpoints so other enterprise apps can plug in.**
- **Optional: Simple dashboard or report generation.**

---

## 💡 Project Goals (POC)

- **Real-time Patent Intelligence**: Constantly gather patent filings, litigation news, legal opinions, competitor filings, and research articles.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Use LangChain & LLMs to identify infringement risks, expired/expiring patents, and emerging “hot” areas.
- **Enterprise-Ready Architecture**: Modular, agentic, and scalable—designed for integration and automation.
- **API-First**: Everything accessible via secure REST endpoints.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** C# (.NET 8+)
- **Web/API Data:** Bright Data, public patent feeds (USPTO, EPO, etc.)
- **AI/NLP:** LangChain (via REST or local service)
- **Protocols:** MCP (Model Connection Protocol), A2A (for agent-to-agent workflow)
- **Frontend:** Minimal React/Blazor UI (optional for reports/dashboards)

---

## 🚦 MVP/POC Scope

1. **Ingest**: Pull patent documents (simulate at first), news, and research feeds
2. **Store & Parse**: Normalize and store patent and news data
3. **Analyze**: Use LangChain & LLM to extract key risk events, summarize, and score
4. **API**: Expose findings (GET /api/patents, /api/risks, /api/trends)
5. **(Optional) UI:** Display summarized risks and trends

---

## 📅 Project Roadmap

- **Week 1**: Repo setup, initial C# scaffolding, fake data ingestion
- **Week 2**: Bright Data/web scraping + public patent feed integration
- **Week 3**: LangChain/LLM integration for risk/trend extraction
- **Week 4**: MCP/A2A agent structure (modular service orchestration)
- **Week 5**: REST API for data exposure; docs
- **Week 6+**: (Optional) Simple dashboard/report UI
